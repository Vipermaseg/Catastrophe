# Catastrophe
Catastrophe aims to simulate an environment to test how MA-PDDL planning algorithms fare in somewhat real situations.
At this point it works only with CMAP[http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/~dborrajo/map.html] and all filesystem routes are hardcoded.
This is part of my work for the subject Advanced Telematic Applications at UPM's ETSIST.

PD: This project uses Lombok, Jackson and jackson-lombok.
